# USB-to-UART-Converter-with-MCP2200
USB to UART converter based on Microchip's MCP2200 integrated circuit, designed to facilitate communication between embedded devices and computers. This project combines robustness, efficiency, and versatility, ideal for developers, engineers, and electronics enthusiasts.

# Key features:
System Core:
MCP2200: Microchip integrated chip that manages the USB-UART conversion with low power consumption and high reliability.
12 MHz Crystal Oscillator: ±50 ppm accuracy for stable communication.
Protection and Reliability:
ESD Diodes (USBLC6-2): Protect the USB lines (D+/D-) from voltage spikes.
RC Filtering Circuits: Eliminate noise on critical signals (e.g., reset).
User-Friendly Interface:
LED Indicators: USB Activity (STATUS), TX, and RX.
UART Header: Pins for TXD, RXD, GND, VCC (3.3V/5V), RTS/CTS (flow control).
Optimized Design:
4-Layer PCB: Solid ground plane, power separation (3.3V and 5V), and USB differential pair with controlled impedance (90Ω).
Professional Assembly: M3 screw holes and clear silkscreen labeling.
